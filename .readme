Fullstack Project 2. 
I've made database in MONGODB. I have tried API's in POSTMAN before and after publishing API's in render.

Render address: https://project-2-269q.onrender.com

Technologies Used
Node.js – Backend runtime
Express.js – Web framework for building RESTful APIs
MongoDB & Mongoose – Database and ODM
Render – Hosting the live API
Postman – Testing API endpoints

API Endpoints
Method	    Endpoint	            Description
GET	        /api/getall	            Get all messages
GET	        /api/:id	            Get a specific message by ID
POST	    /api/add	            Add a new message
PUT	        /api/update/:id	        Update a message by ID
DELETE	    /api/delete/:id	        Delete a message by ID

My project is a full stack Node.js application that provides a REST API for managing da-ta stored in MongoDB. I learned how to create and connect a backend server to a cloud database and make it accessible through API routes.

I have used the following technologies and tools:
•	Node.js and Express.js for building the backend server
•	MongoDB and Mongoose for the database
•	Postman for testing all API routes
•	Render for publishing and hosting the project online
The application handles five main API routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and sends responses as JSON.

My project aim is to create a simple and reliable REST API where users can add, read, update, and delete messages.
The project focuses on backend logic, so no visual frontend was required. I designed the API to be clear, well-structured, and easy to test with tools like Postman.

I succeeded in connecting MongoDB to my Node.js server and deploying the project suc-cessfully to Render.
I could do better in improving the frontend part and adding more validation for user in-put.
I see that I have learned how to use Express routes, Mongoose models, and environ-ment variables securely
