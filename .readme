Fullstack Project 2. 
I've made database in MONGODB. I have tried API's in POSTMAN before and after publishing API's in render.

Render address: https://project-2-269q.onrender.com

Technologies Used
Node.js – Backend runtime
Express.js – Web framework for building RESTful APIs
MongoDB & Mongoose – Database and ODM
Render – Hosting the live API
Postman – Testing API endpoints
